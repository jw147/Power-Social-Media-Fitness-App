# Power: Improve. Connect. Learn
Power is a social media fitness app that ranks users based on their experience, age, weight & ability
creating a way for users to linearly track their progress from a person to person basis.
Users will be given the option to use the app online privately (with friends)
or online publicly (with the entire app).

The aim of Power is to create a beginner friendly health & fitness app that connects 
you to like-minded individuals with similar goals or interests. Power will provide everything that a
fitness app requires (workout plans/planners, diet plans/planners, exercise tutorials and fitness
knowledge that anyone can benefit from) and more.
